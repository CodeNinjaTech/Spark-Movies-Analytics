We then casted the \"users_rating\" and \"votes\" columns into float and integer data types respectively. We used then the `printSchema()` function to observe that everything worked well and then used the `toPandas()` function, which as the name suggests, returns the contents of this DataFrame as Pandas `pandas.DataFrame`, in order to view it in a more pretty way than it is printed with the `show()` function.\n",
